We've all seen the mandatory emergency contact forms in school, work, and event paperwork. It serves an important purpose. In case of an emergency, others may need to contact someone you know when you can't do so yourself.

It may seem antiquated these days but if you have a landline, keep a list of emergency contacts next to the phone. A simple landline may not have speed dial. If you have kids, they may not remember a phone number, especially in an emergency. Or they may need to call several numbers to reach someone.

If you have a smartphone, you can [store emergency contacts on your phone](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/android-iphone-emergency-contact-ice_l_5ce2e6aee4b075a35a2b9250). Once entered, someone can access these contacts without unlocking your phone. If you have an iPhone, you can even add [allergies and other medical conditions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207021) to the Health app. This too will be accessible without unlocking your phone.

Though it's unlikely to be used, making this information easily accessible could save your life.
