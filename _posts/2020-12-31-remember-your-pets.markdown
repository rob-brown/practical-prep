It's important to have an emergency plan for your family. But don't forget about the rest of your family: your pets.

If you are injured or otherwise unable to return home, you will need someone who can get to your pets and take care of them. If you need to evacuate, be aware that many shelters will not take pets. They will need some other kind of accommodation.

The key things to plan for are food, water, shelter, and any medical needs for your pets. Here are some other things to consider:

* Identification (collar, photos) in case your pet is lost.
* A friend with a key to your home to get to your pets.
* A kennel/carrier or litter box.
* A list of places to stay.
* An animal first aid kit.
* A list of daily routines.
* A list of your pets' preferences or quirks.
* Toys, bed, and food/water bowls.
