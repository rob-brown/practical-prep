When it comes to preparation, it's critical to have redundancies. This doesn't just mean to have a backup radio in case one fails. This doesn't just mean having extras like batteries or water. It's also about having variety.

What I mean is having different items that fill similar yet overlapped needs. Here are some examples.

## Food

* Favorite foods
* MREs (Meals Ready-to-Eat)
* Canned foods
* Long-term staples

## Water

* Bottled water
* 55-gallon drum
* Water purification tablets
* Water filter

## Light

* Flashlight
* Head lamp
* Propane lantern
* Glow sticks

## Communication

* Cell phone
* Walkie talkies
* Hand-cranked radio
* Whistle
* HAM radio

Each of these can fill a need slightly differently. For example, a flashlight is a great light source. Sometimes you want the hands-free convenience of a head lamp. Propane lanterns don't need batteries and their tank can be used with a portable stove. Glow sticks are water proof and don't make sparks that could ignite a gas leak.

As you plan how to fill our needs in an emergency, take time to find different ways to fill those needs.
