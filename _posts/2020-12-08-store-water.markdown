There may be times where you are without water. It may not even be an emergency. This summer we were without water for several hours because the water main was being worked on. On a separate occasion, we had a boil order from the city. Being prepared made these situations much easier.

There are different recommendations for how much water you need. [Ready.gov][1] recommends a gallon per person per day for three days. Don't forget about pets too. [FEMA][2] recommends two weeks worth of water. The important thing is to evaluate your needs. For example, nursing mothers or those in hot climates will need more water.

If you don't buy commercially bottled water you can use soft-drink bottles. Don't use milk or juice bottles. Clean them thoroughly with soap and a diluted bleach solution (1 teaspoon per quart of water). Store the water in a cool dark place and cycle it out every six months. You should write the date on the bottle so you know when it was filled.

A great way to reduce your water usage is to use baby wipes and hand sanitizer for personal cleansing. This saves more water for drinking and other needs.
