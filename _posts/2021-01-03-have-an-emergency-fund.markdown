There will be times unexpected costs come up. It could be a broken appliance. It could be a physical injury. The reasons are countless but one solution helps: keep some extra money to absorb the financial shock.

The first question it, how much do you need to save? Some say [3 to 6 months](https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/quick-guide-to-your-emergency-fund). Others say a [minimum of ~$2500](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/18/minimum-amount-of-money-you-need-in-an-emergency-fund.html). Really it will vary according to your circumstances. If you haven't saved anything, it can take a while to build up an emergency fund. If your income is unstable, then you may need more saved away than if you had a stable income. It can also vary depending on any debt you may have. Anything you save now can provide peace-of-mind later.

Once you have an emergency fund, don't fall for the temptation to use it to buy some new gadget. That's what a savings account is for. Ask yourself, is it [unexpected, necessary, and urgent](https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/3-questions-emergency-fund)? If it isn't, then don't use your emergency fund for it.
