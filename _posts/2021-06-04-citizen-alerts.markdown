Many cities and counties provide a citizen alert system that will call or text you with timely information when an emergency arises. During the time we've lived in our current home, we've received alerts for a power outage, a boil order, and a missing child.

Take some time right now to find your local citizen alert system. It should only take a few minutes. Or for those in Utah, here are some convenient links:
