Before starting to prepare, you need to develop a plan. The following steps will help in building out a plan for your personal needs:

1. Identify likely disasters
2. Identify disrupted necessities
3. Prioritize which to prepare for first
4. Identify how to offset disruptions
5. Practice plans
6. Repeat for other disasters

## Identify likely disasters

Here's a list of common disasters:

* Natural
  - Earthquake
  - Fire
  - Flood
  - Winter Storm
  - Heat Wave
  - Tornado
  - Hurricane
  - Volcano

* Man Made
  - Unemployment
  - Injury 
  - Disease
  - Death

This is not a comprehensive list but it's a good place to start. Not all emergencies are applicable. A winter storm is unlikely in the tropics. A volcano obviously requires a volcano nearby. 

## Identify disrupted necessities

With the types of disasters identified, you next need to determine what will get disrupted. For example:

* Power
* Heat
* Food/water
* Communication
* Income
* Health insurance
* Mental/emotional health

As you identify different needs you will see overlaps between different types of disasters. This will be important later. 

## Prioritize what to prepare

We all have limited means whether is be money, time, storage capacity, or other restrictions. Similarly, you never know exactly what emergency will strike or when. This is where the overlap between emergency scenarios is important. You can prepare for multiple emergencies more economically by first addressing common needs.

## Identify how to offset disruptions

Speaking of filling needs, here are some idea of filling those needs. 

| Need | Temporary Fulfillment |
|:---|:---|
| Power | Generator, USB backup battery, flashlights |
| Heat | Blankets, jackets, portable heater |
| Food/water | Food and water storage |
| Communication | Radio, walkie talkies |
| Income/health insurance | Emergency fund |
| Mental/emotional health | Family, friends, simple games |

Note that these only provide temporary relief. You don't need to survive indefinitely, just long enough for a long-term solution. 

## Practice plans

Without practicing a plan, you may not remember it or act as quickly when the time comes to use that plan. This is why schools practice fire and earthquake drills, for example. Depending on the emergency, there are many ways to practice the plan:

* Practice escape routes
* Eat food storage as you cycle food in and out
* Take a first aid course
* Live within a budget
* Save money in an emergency fund
* Take time for self care

## Repeat for other disasters

Over time you will better equipped and more comfortable with your plan. You can then repeat this process for other types of emergencies. Or you can prepare more deeply for specific emergencies. 

## Conclusion

While this post doesn't cover every scenario it should give you a place to start. Remember to prioritize, plan, and practice.
