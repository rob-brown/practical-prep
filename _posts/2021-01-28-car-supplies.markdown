By having emergency supplies in your car you will be better prepared for an emergency of your own or you may be able to help someone else in need. Here are some common supplies. Your needs may vary depending on your environment, ex. snow, desert, rain.

* Road-side repair kit
* First aid kit
* Water and non-perishable food
* Blankets or jackets
* Trenching tool
* Duct tape
* Road maps
* Fire extinguisher

A road-side repair kit could contain many tools and supplies:

* Spare tire and jack
* Basic tool kit
* Flashlight
* Jumper cables
* Tow strap
* Tire inflater
* Flares or reflectors

Be sure to check your spare tire a couple times per year to make sure it's properly inflated. Or better yet, keep a tire inflator on hand.

See the [National Safety Council](https://www.nsc.org/home-safety/safety-topics/emergency-preparedness/car-kit) and [Allstate](https://www.allstate.com/tr/car-insurance/assembling-emergency-car-kit.aspx) for more ideas.
