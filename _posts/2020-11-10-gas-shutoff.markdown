If a gas line is ever ruptured, say by an earthquake, it's important to know how to shut off the gas. First, you need to know where your meter is. Here's a picture of my gas meter.

You'll notice that I also have a small wrench hanging from it. If you have a gas leak, you can't waste time digging through your tool box to find it. It's also best to use a wrench made of a non-sparking alloy. You can also get a [wrench for gas and water valves](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001CSCC7I).

When the gas is on, the tang will run the same direction as the pipe. When it's off it will point perpendicularly. The valve only turns a quarter turn. If there is resistance you may be turning the wrong way or too much. Don't force it.

Before you go trying this out for yourself, do **not** turn off your gas unless you suspect a leak. Once off, you need to call the gas company to come and turn it on for you. This is a precaution to make sure everything is working fine. It's better to be safe than sorry.
