Whether in your car or on your person, there are various supplies you should have on hand in an emergency. There are countless sources that will list out things for your every day carry (EDC). Rather than repeat these, I will share the top three things I use from my EDC.

By far my most used item is my multitool. With its knife, scissors, screwdrivers, pliers, tweezers, and more I use it just about every day. I use it so often that I wear out one or more tools and replace it every few years.

My next most used item is my handkerchief. Carrying a pack of tissues can be a bit bulky but a handkerchief hides almost imperceptibly in my pocket. My wife and kids seem to use it the most to wipe up tears or blow a nose. It's great for an impromptu napkin. It can also be used as a bandage or splint in a pinch (if clean).

I also keep a few bandages in my wallet. Together they are smaller than a credit card. I've used them many times when my kids scraped their knee at the park or I cut myself while working on a wood project. It's nice to quickly grab them from my wallet rather than running around trying to find one while bleeding on everything I touch.

Evaluate your needs and make your own EDC. You may be surprised how often you use simple items.
