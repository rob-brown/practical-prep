The motto of the [Citizen Emergency Response Team (CERT)](https://www.ready.gov/cert) is "do the greatest good for the greatest number." If you are willing, and in a position to help, then CERT is a great way to do so.

> The Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) program is a nationally supported, locally implemented initiative that teaches people how to better prepare themselves for hazards that may affect their communities. CERT trains them in basic disaster response skills such as team organization, disaster medical operations, fire safety, and light search and rescue. Local CERT programs train and organize teams of volunteers to assist their families, neighbors, co-workers, and other community members during emergencies when professional responders may not be immediately available to provide assistance. Before, during, and after disasters, CERT volunteer teams perform basic response activities, including checking in on neighbors, distributing information to the public, supporting emergency operations centers, and helping to manage traffic and crowds. The ability for CERT volunteers to perform these activities frees up professional responders to focus their efforts on more complex, essential, and critical tasks. CERT volunteers also support their communities by organizing, promoting, and participating in emergency preparedness events, activities, and projects.

I went through the CERT training over a year ago. It is the motivation for providing easy access to emergency preparation on this site. After going through the training I feel better prepared to not only get my family through an emergency but to also help and lead others through it.
