There may be times you are separated from loved ones. Other times you may not be able to return home. To be prepared, you should plan ahead and agree on places to go or meet.

## 1. Somewhere near your home.

In the event of a home fire you will need to quickly evacuate your home. You should have somewhere to meet so you know when everyone has evacuated. For example, you could meet across the street at a neighbor's home.

## 2. Somewhere outside your neighborhood.

A wildfire or earthquake may require you to evacuate somewhere outside of your neighborhood. It could be with a friend or family member in town or in a neighboring city.

## 3. Somewhere more distant.

In a wide-spread disaster such as a hurricane, flood, or tornado, you may need to evacuate. In these situations, you should have a place to stay, possibly out of state.
