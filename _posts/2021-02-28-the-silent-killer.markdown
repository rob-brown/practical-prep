Carbon monoxide (CO) is known as the silent killer. It's a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that you can't sense.

Last year we had an experience with CO. We had been canning apple sauce all day. We had just laid down for bed when our CO detector went off. We didn't think about all the CO our gas stove produced throughout the day. We quickly opened the windows and left the house for a little while, averting a fatal disaster.

Like a smoke detector, a CO detector should be located by sleeping areas. In fact, you can get both detectors in a single unit.

When placing CO detectors, keep the following in mind:

* Have at least one per level.
* Have one near sleeping areas.
* Keep out of direct sunlight.
* Keep away from vents and obstructions.
* Place one near an attached garage.

Unlike smoke detectors, CO detectors are based on concentration and time. Even low levels of CO will trigger the detector if present for long enough.
