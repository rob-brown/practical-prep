There are countless sources that will list out things for your every day carry (EDC). Rather than repeat these, I will share the top three things I use from my EDC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By far my most used item is my multitool. With its knife, scissors, screwdrivers, pliers, tweezers, and more I use it just about every day. I use it so often that I wear out one or more tools and replace it every few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next most used item is my handkerchief. Carrying a pack of tissues can be a bit bulky but a handkerchief hides almost imperceptibly in my pocket. My wife and kids seem to use it the most to wipe up tears or blow a nose. It’s great for an impromptu napkin. It can also be used as a bandage or splint in a pinch (if clean).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also keep a few bandages in my wallet. Together they are smaller than a credit card. I’ve used them many times when my kids scraped their knee at the park or I cut myself while working on a wood project. It’s nice to quickly grab them from my wallet rather than running around trying to find one while bleeding on everything I touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evaluate your needs and make your own EDC. You may be surprised how often you use simple items.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Robert Brown</name></author><summary type="html">Whether in your car or on your person, there are various supplies you should have on hand in an emergency.

With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, countless people rushed to stores to buy water, soap, toilet paper, and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewedcom/2020/04/20/24-products-selling-out-online-due-coronavirus-pandemic-toilet-paper-cleaning-wipes-yeast-and-more/5161629002/&quot;&gt;Nintendo Switches&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s good to have your own store of essentials. Though in an emergency, buying up as many goods as you can is not helpful. Stores and manufacturers can only supply so much in a short period. This impulse to hoard can leave many others without their needs fulfilled. For example, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers or bottled water for those displaced from their homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take time to identify your needs and buy just a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; bit more than your immediate needs. In time you will have enough to weather through an emergency when it comes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Robert Brown</name></author><summary type="html">Once an emergency strikes, the time to prepare is over.

It’s a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that you can’t sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year we had an experience with CO. We had been canning apple sauce all day. We had just laid down for bed when our CO detector went off. We didn’t think about all the CO our gas stove produced throughout the day. We quickly opened the windows and left the house for a little while, averting a fatal disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like a smoke detector, a CO detector should be located by sleeping areas. In fact, you can get both detectors in a single unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When placing CO detectors, keep the following in mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have at least one per level.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have one near sleeping areas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep out of direct sunlight.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep away from vents and obstructions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Place one near an attached garage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike smoke detectors, CO detectors are based on concentration and time. Even low levels of CO will trigger the detector if present for long enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) program is a nationally supported, locally implemented initiative that teaches people how to better prepare themselves for hazards that may affect their communities. CERT trains them in basic disaster response skills such as team organization, disaster medical operations, fire safety, and light search and rescue. Local CERT programs train and organize teams of volunteers to assist their families, neighbors, co-workers, and other community members during emergencies when professional responders may not be immediately available to provide assistance. Before, during, and after disasters, CERT volunteer teams perform basic response activities, including checking in on neighbors, distributing information to the public, supporting emergency operations centers, and helping to manage traffic and crowds. The ability for CERT volunteers to perform these activities frees up professional responders to focus their efforts on more complex, essential, and critical tasks. CERT volunteers also support their communities by organizing, promoting, and participating in emergency preparedness events, activities, and projects.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;— &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ready.gov/sites/default/files/2019.CERT_.Basic_.PM_FINAL_508c.pdf&quot;&gt;CERT Participant Manual&lt;/a&gt;, p. 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went through the CERT training over a year ago. It is the motivation for providing easy access to emergency preparation on this site. After going through the training I feel better prepared to not only get my family through an emergency but to also help and lead others through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may seem antiquated these days but if you have a landline, keep a list of emergency contacts next to the phone. A simple landline may not have speed dial. If you have kids, they may not remember a phone number, especially in an emergency. Or they may need to call several numbers to reach someone.&lt;/p&gt;

It could be a broken appliance. It could be a physical injury. The reasons are countless but one solution helps: keep some extra money to absorb the financial shock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first question it, how much do you need to save? Some say &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/quick-guide-to-your-emergency-fund&quot;&gt;3 to 6 months&lt;/a&gt;. Others say a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/18/minimum-amount-of-money-you-need-in-an-emergency-fund.html&quot;&gt;minimum of ~$2500&lt;/a&gt;. Really it will vary according to your circumstances. If you haven’t saved anything, it can take a while to build up an emergency fund. If your income is unstable, then you may need more saved away than if you had a stable income. It can also vary depending on any debt you may have. Anything you save now can provide peace-of-mind later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have an emergency fund, don’t fall for the temptation to use it to buy some new gadget. That’s what a savings account is for. Ask yourself, is it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/3-questions-emergency-fund&quot;&gt;unexpected, necessary, and urgent&lt;/a&gt;?

But don’t forget about the rest of your family: your pets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are injured or otherwise unable to return home, you will need someone who can get to your pets and take care of them. If you need to evacuate, be aware that many shelters will not take pets. They will need some other kind of accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key things to plan for are food, water, shelter, and any medical needs for your pets. Here are some other things to consider:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identification (collar, photos) in case your pet is lost.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A friend with a key to your home to get to your pets.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A kennel/carrier or litter box.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A list of places to stay.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An animal first aid kit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A list of daily routines.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A list of your pets’ preferences or quirks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Toys, bed, and food/water bowls.&lt;/li&gt;
