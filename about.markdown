I am one of several emergency coordinators for my small town. I am a CERT-trained emergency responder and a licensed HAM radio operator (KJ7RPN).

As I help others in my community I find that few know where to start or even think about emergency scenarios.  Preparing for an emergency can be a daunting task. It can be hard to know where to start. Rather than focus on preparing for doomsday, my intent is to provide small, practical ways to prepare for disasters both natural and man-made.
