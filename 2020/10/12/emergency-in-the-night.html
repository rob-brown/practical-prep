    <p>Recently we have had some earthquakes nearby. Fortunately they weren’t close enough to do much here. Other family members were much closer. They had minor damage and felt the aftershocks for weeks.</p>

<p>The earthquakes happened just after we had gotten up for the day. What if the earthquake had started a few hours earlier? Here are some tips to be prepared.</p>

<h2 id="do-not-hang-anything-heavy-near-beds">Do NOT hang anything heavy near beds</h2>

<p>Pictures, shelves, objects on shelves, lamps, and other heavy objects can become projectiles during an earthquake. A canvas print of your family above your bed may look great but you don’t want to wake up with it in your face.</p>

<h2 id="anchor-heavy-furniture-to-the-walls">Anchor heavy furniture to the walls</h2>

<p>Anchoring furniture will keep it from falling over and causing damage. Additionally, anchors will protect kids from pulling furniture on top of themselves.</p>

<h2 id="keep-a-flashlight-in-every-bedroom">Keep a flashlight in every bedroom</h2>

<p>Earthquakes and other disasters can knock out the power. You don’t want to fumble about over toppled furniture just to reach the light switch and find the power is out. I keep a flashlight on my bed-side table where I can grab it easily.</p>

<h2 id="keep-slippers-or-shoes-by-your-bed">Keep slippers or shoes by your bed</h2>

<p>Speaking about fumbling about in the dark, you don’t want to be surprised by broken glass on the floor. Keep some footwear by your bed and save a lot of pain.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This post focuses on earthquakes but it applies to other disasters too. Make these simple changes and rest more easily at night.</p>
